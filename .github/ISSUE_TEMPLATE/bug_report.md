## Issue Type

There are a few types of issues:

1. **Build-time issue**: you get either a compile-time error or warning while building **cdecl**.
2. **Run-time issue**: given particular input, **cdecl** either gives incorrect output or crashes.
3. **Documentation issue**: part of the documentation (man page, Doxygen, or source code comment) is wrong, unclear, or has a typographical or grammatical error.
4. **Enhancement request**: something **cdecl** currently doesn't do (or does do, but not in a way you'd like), but you'd like it to.

If your issue is none of those, **DO NOT CREATE AN ISSUE**. It will be closed and deleted. General comments and questions should be sent by e-mail instead.

## Build-time Issue

**What error or warning did you get?**
Please include **_only_** the error or warning message line of output and **_not_** the entire build output (unless subsequently requested).

**What compiler and version are you using?**
Please include the output given by your compiler when you request its version information (typically via the `--version` command-line option).

**What operating system and version (Linux, FreeBSD, macOS, etc.) are you building on?**

## Run-time Issue

**What was the input given to cdecl?**
Please include **_only_** the input necessary to elicit the bug.

**What output was given by cdecl?**

**What output did you expect to be given by cdecl?**

**If cdecl crashed, what was the crash message?**


## Documentation Issue

**What file is the documentation in (if known)?**

**Please copy & paste the relevant part of the documentation and briefly explain what's wrong with it.**


## Enhancement Request

**What would you like **cdecl** to do?**
