** Fixed new-style casts C++ version
New-style casts are now permitted as far back as C++98.


* Changes in Cdecl 3.4

** Static & type-qualified arrays
Added support for C99 static and type-qualified array function arguments, e.g.:
    void f( int a[static const 10] );

** Variable length arrays
Added support for C99 variable length array function arguments, e.g.:
    void f( int a[*] );
    void g( int a[const *] );

** Help command-line argument
Now prints the help message and exits if the first command-line argument is
"help".

** Fixed reference to array
The generated gibberish for "reference to array" has been fixed.


* Changes in Cdecl 3.3

** Help command-line option
Added the command-line options of -h or --help that prints the usage message.

** Fixed const pointers to members
Explaining const/volatile pointers to members now works.


* Changes in Cdecl 3.2

** C++ new-style casts
Added support for C++ new-style casts.

** Language-sensitive autocompletion
Autocompletion is now language-sensitive in that it will not offer completions
that are not valid in the current language.

** Context-sensitive autocompletion
Autocompletion is now slightly more context-sensitive in that it will offer
only command keywords for the first word in the input.

** Fixed command-line error printing
Command-line input is now printed when there's an error.


* Changes in Cdecl 3.1.5

** Fixed color prompt caret position
The position of the caret in error messages when using color prompts has been
fixed.


* Changes in Cdecl 3.1.4

The <cv-qualifier> in the help text was missing '>'.


* Changes in Cdecl 3.1.3

** Fixed synonyms in explain
Explanations no longer wrongly allow English synonyms.


* Changes in Cdecl 3.1.2

** Fixed declarations with storage-class
Declarations like:
    declare x as static pointer to function returning int
    declare x as type pointer to function returning int
are fixed.


* Changes in Cdecl 3.1.1

** Parallel builds
Parallel builds are fixed.

** Manual page caveats
Added additional caveats: qualified C++ data members or member functions are
not supported.


* Changes in Cdecl 3.1

** Ref-qualifiers
Now supports C++11 function ref-qualifiers.

** Installs c++decl
A "make install" will now also create c++decl as a symbolic link to cdecl.


* Changes in Cdecl 3.0.1

** Renamed --disable-debug to --disable-cdecl-debug
Renamed this configure option to avoid clash with conventional --disable-debug
option.


* Changes in Cdecl 3.0

** GNU Autotools
The GNU Autotools suite is now used to build.

** GNU-style test suite and many more tests
There are now over 500 unit tests that can be run via "make check".

** More semantic checks
Many more semantic checks have been added to disallow invalid declarations.

** Long command-line options
Long (GNU-style) command-line options, e.g., --language, are now accepted.

** Multi-line input
Long commands can now be given across multiple lines by escaping the newlines
with a backslash.

** More C and C++ versions
Now distinguishes among K&R C, C89, C95, C99, C11, C++98, C++03, C++11, and
C++14.

** More types
Now supports _Atomic, bool, char16_t, char32_t, complex, noreturn, restrict,
thread_local, and wchar_t.

** Inline functions
Added inline function support.

** Function arguments
Added register and variadic function argument support (independently).

** Typedef declarations

** Optional returning
In pseudo-English for functions, the "returning" clause is now optional and
equivalent to returning void.

Binary, octal, and hexadecimal numbers can now be used for array sizes.

** Better warning an error messages
Warning and error messages are now better, complete with location information
and color.

** Comments
C /*...*/ and C++ // comments are now ignored.

** No cdecl reserved words in C declarations
Reserved words that are part of cdecl's pseudo-English are no longer considered
such when explaining C or C++ declarations.

* Revamped manual page.
