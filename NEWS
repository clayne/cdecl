-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Changes in Cdecl 6.2

** Added C++11 user-defined literal support
Added support for user-defined literals.  For example:

    cdecl> explain int operator"" _a(unsigned long long x)
    declare _a as user-defined literal (x as unsigned long long) returning int

** More commands as first argument
More commands (define, namespace, set, static, typedef, and using) are now
recognized as such when they are the first argument.

** Added support for char8_t
Now supports C++20's char8_t.

** Added support for more standard types
Added typedef declarations for div_t, imaxdiv_t, ldiv_t, lldiv_t, sig_atomic_t,
streambuf, streamoff, streamsize, and wstreambuf.


* Changes in Cdecl 6.1

** Final or override now implies virtual
Either final or override in a function's signature now implies it's virtual:

    cdecl> explain void f() override
    declare f as overridden virtual member function returning void


* Changes in Cdecl 6.0.2

** Added strndup()
Added Gnulib's strndup() for systems that don't have it.

** Fixed cast warning
Fixed "cast to pointer from integer of different size" on some compilers.


* Changes in Cdecl 6.0.1

** Fixed undefined uint64_t
Fixed a compile-time error on some platforms.


* Changes in Cdecl 6.0

** Added C++ scoped name support
Added support for scoped names in C++.  For example:

    cdecl> explain int S::x
    declare x of scope S as int
    cdecl> define S::T as struct T; explain S::T x
    declare x as T of scope S

** Added partial namespace support
Specifically, you can now perform typedef and using declarations within
namespaces or inline namespaces:

    c++decl> namespace S { inline namespace T { typedef int Int; } }
    c++decl> show user typedef
    namespace S::T { typedef int Int; }


* Changes in Cdecl 5.2

** Added digraph and trigraph support
Added support for digraphs and trigraphs.


* Changes in Cdecl 5.1

** Added C++20 support
Specifically, consteval functions, operator<=>(), and predefined typedefs were
added: partial_ordering, strong_equality, strong_ordering, weak_equality, and
weak_ordering.

** Added C18 support
Since C18 is only a bugfix version, "C18" is merely recognized as a valid
version of C.


* Changes in Cdecl 5.0

** Added all C/C++ keywords
All C/C++ keywords have been added to the lexer/parser to prevent declaring
variables or functions having names that are keywords.  For example:

    declare break as int

is now correctly reported as an error.

Additionally, names that are keywords is later versions of C/C++, while legal,
now issue warnings, e.g.:

    cdecl> declare class as int
                   ^
    18: warning: "class" is a keyword in C++98
    int class;

** Operator overloading
Added support for composing and deciphering C++ overloaded operators:

    c++decl> explain bool operator()() const override
    declare () as overridden virtual constant member operator returning bool

** Fixed const/volatile reference
Declarations of the form:

    declare r as const reference to int
    declare r as volatile reference to int

are now correctly reported as an error.

** Added member/non-member to functions
You can now explcitly specify either "member" or "non-member" in declarations:

    declare f as const member function

Additionally, cdecl will include "member" in function explanations when it can
infer a function is a member function:

    cdecl> explain void f() const
    declare f as constant member function returning void

** Fixed friend const/volatile/override/final/virtual/reference functions
Declarations of the form:

    declare f as friend const function returning bool

are now correctly reported as an error.


* Changes in Cdecl 4.8.1

** Fixed ^ position
An error in a second (or subsequent) command after a ';', e.g.:

    typedef int Int; show foo

now correctly positions the ^.


* Changes in Cdecl 4.8

** Show command improvement
The show command can now show the definition of a type in English (same as
before, but now the default) or in gibberish as a typedef (new, optional).

Note also that the trailing "types" keyword has been removed from the command:
it wasn't needed.


* Changes in Cdecl 4.7

** Added more predefined typedefs
More predefined typedefs were added: blkcnt_t, blksize_t, clockid_t, clock_t,
dev_t, errno_t, FILE, fpos_t, gid_t, in_addr_t, ino_t, in_port_t, mbstate_t,
mode_t, nlink_t, off_t, pid_t, rlim_t, rsize_t, sa_family_t, socklen_t,
suseconds_t, time_t, uid_t, useconds_t, and wint_t.


* Changes in Cdecl 4.6.1

Explaining unnamed array function arguments like:

    void f(char[])

now works.

now correctly reports the unknown type.


* Changes in Cdecl 4.4.1

** Fixed typedef of pointer-to-function
A typedef like:

    typedef void (*f)(int)

now works correctly.

** Added CONFIGURATION FILE section
The cdecl(1) man page now contains a CONFIGURATION FILE section.

The C++ attrribute specifiers carries_dependency, deprecated, noreturn,
maybe_unused, and nodiscard are now supported.


* Changes in Cdecl 4.3

** Added C99 _Imaginary number support
C99 _Imaginary number declarations are now supported.

** External
The keyword "external" is now a synonym for "extern".

** More English for explain
More English synonyms are used in explanations, e.g.:

    declare x as automatic
    declare x as constant int
    declare x as enumeration E
    declare x as structure S


* Changes in Cdecl 4.2

** Added noexcept and throw() support
Function declarations may now include exception specifications.

** Fixed handling of leading whitespace in command-line argument
The unusual case of:

    cdecl ' declare x as int'

i.e., a quoted argument having leading whitespace, is now handled correctly.


* Changes in Cdecl 4.1

is now correctly reported as an error.


* Changes in Cdecl 4.0

** Added C++17 support
Specifically, inline variable declarations are now supported.

** New typedef and define commands
New typedef gibberish and define english commands have been added to allow new
types to be defined that can then be used in subsequent declarations and
explanations.

** New C99 standard types
The following C99 types are now supported via the new typedef command:
int8_t, int16_t, int32_t, int64_t, int_fast8_t, int_fast16_t, int_fast32_t,

** New --no-typedefs/-t command-line options
Either of these options suppresses the definition of the standard C99 types.

** Reads configuration file
Upon start-up and if it exists, reads ~/.cdeclrc (by default) for user-defined
typedef or define commands.

** New --config/-c command-line options
These options specify an alternate configuration file to read upon start-up.
As a result, the -c option in earlier versions of cdecl used to specify when to
colorize output has been renamed to -k.

** New --no-config/-C command-line options
These options suppress the reading of a configuration file, even one explicitly
specified via --config/-c.

** New show command
A new show command has been added to show the definition of either predefined
or user-defined types.

** Register warning
The use of "register" now triggers a warning in C++11 and later.


* Changes in Cdecl 3.6

** First word of first argument
The first word of the first non-option command-line argument is now also
checked to see if it's a command thus allowing fully quoted strings:

    $ cdecl 'explain int *const p'


* Changes in Cdecl 3.5

** Added ssize_t
Similar to size_t, support for ssize_t has been added.


* Changes in Cdecl 3.4.1

New-style casts are now permitted as far back as C++98.


* Changes in Cdecl 3.4

** Static & type-qualified arrays
Added support for C99 static and type-qualified array function arguments, e.g.:

    void f( int a[static const 10] );

** Variable length arrays
Added support for C99 variable length array function arguments, e.g.:

    void f( int a[*] );
    void g( int a[const *] );

** Help command-line argument
Now prints the help message and exits if the first command-line argument is
"help".

** Fixed const pointers to members
Explaining const/volatile pointers to members now works.


* Changes in Cdecl 3.2

** C++ new-style casts
Added support for C++ new-style casts.

** Language-sensitive autocompletion
Autocompletion is now language-sensitive in that it will not offer completions
that are not valid in the current language.

** Context-sensitive autocompletion
Autocompletion is now slightly more context-sensitive in that it will offer
only command keywords for the first word in the input.

** Fixed command-line error printing
Command-line input is now printed when there's an error.


* Changes in Cdecl 3.1.5

** Fixed color prompt caret position
The position of the caret in error messages when using color prompts has been
fixed.
