-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Changes in Cdecl 4.2

** Added noexcept and throw() support
Function declarations may now include exception specifications.

** Fixed handling of leading whitespace in command-line argument
The unusual case of:
    cdecl ' declare x as int'
i.e., a quoted argument having leading whitespace, is now handled correctly.


* Changes in Cdecl 4.1

** New C11 standard atomic types
The following C11 atomic types are now supported via the new typedef command:
atomic_bool, atomic_char, atomic_schar, atomic_char16_t, atomic_char32_t,
atomic_wchar_t, atomic_short, atomic_int, atomic_long, atomic_llong,
atomic_uchar, atomic_ushort, atomic_uint, atomic_ulong, atomic_ullong,
atomic_ptrdiff_t, atomic_size_t, atomic_intmax_t, atomic_intptr_t,
atomic_uintptr_t, atomic_uintmax_t, atomic_int_fast8_t, atomic_int_fast16_t,
atomic_int_fast32_t, atomic_int_fast64_t, atomic_uint_fast8_t,
atomic_uint_fast16_t, atomic_uint_fast32_t, atomic_uint_fast64_t,
atomic_int_least8_t, atomic_int_least16_t, atomic_int_least32_t,
atomic_int_least64_t, atomic_uint_least8_t, atomic_uint_least16_t,
atomic_uint_least32_t, and atomic_uint_least64_t.

** Fixed typedef and define commands with storage classes
Typedef and define now prohibit storage classes, e.g.:
    typedef static int sint;
is now correctly reported as an error.


* Changes in Cdecl 4.0

** Added C++17 support
Specifically, inline variable declarations are now supported.

** New typedef and define commands
New typedef gibberish and define english commands have been added to allow new
types to be defined that can then be used in subsequent declarations and
explanations.

** New C99 standard types
The following C99 types are now supported via the new typedef command:
int8_t, int16_t, int32_t, int64_t, int_fast8_t, int_fast16_t, int_fast32_t,
int_fast64_t, int_least16_t, int_least32_t, int_least64_t, int_least8_t,
intmax_t, intptr_t, ptrdiff_t, uint8_t, uint16_t, uint32_t, uint64_t,
uint_fast8_t, uint_fast16_t, uint_fast32_t, uint_fast64_t, uint_least8_t,
uint_least16_t, uint_least32_t, uint_least64_t, uintmax_t, and uintptr_t.

** New --no-typedefs/-t command-line options
Either of these options suppresses the definition of the standard C99 types.

** Reads configuration file
Upon start-up and if it exists, reads ~/.cdeclrc (by default) for user-defined
typedef or define commands.

** New --config/-c command-line options
These options specify an alternate configuration file to read upon start-up.
As a result, the -c option in earlier versions of cdecl used to specify when to
colorize output has been renamed to -k.

** New --no-config/-C command-line options
These options suppress the reading of a configuration file, even one explicitly
specified via --config/-c.

** New show command
A new show command has been added to show the definition of either predefined
or user-defined types.

** Register warning
The use of "register" now triggers a warning in C++11 and later.


* Changes in Cdecl 3.6

** First word of first argument
The first word of the first non-option command-line argument is now also
checked to see if it's a command thus allowing fully quoted strings:
    $ cdecl 'explain int *const p'


* Changes in Cdecl 3.5

** Added ssize_t
Similar to size_t, support for ssize_t has been added.


* Changes in Cdecl 3.4.1

** Fixed new-style casts C++ version
New-style casts are now permitted as far back as C++98.


* Changes in Cdecl 3.4

** Static & type-qualified arrays
Added support for C99 static and type-qualified array function arguments, e.g.:
    void f( int a[static const 10] );

** Variable length arrays
Added support for C99 variable length array function arguments, e.g.:
    void f( int a[*] );
    void g( int a[const *] );

** Help command-line argument
Now prints the help message and exits if the first command-line argument is
"help".

** Fixed reference to array
The generated gibberish for "reference to array" has been fixed.


* Changes in Cdecl 3.3

** Help command-line option
Added the command-line options of -h or --help that prints the usage message.

** Fixed const pointers to members
Explaining const/volatile pointers to members now works.


* Changes in Cdecl 3.2

** C++ new-style casts
Added support for C++ new-style casts.

** Language-sensitive autocompletion
Autocompletion is now language-sensitive in that it will not offer completions
that are not valid in the current language.

** Context-sensitive autocompletion
Autocompletion is now slightly more context-sensitive in that it will offer
only command keywords for the first word in the input.

** Fixed command-line error printing
Command-line input is now printed when there's an error.


* Changes in Cdecl 3.1.5

** Fixed color prompt caret position
The position of the caret in error messages when using color prompts has been
fixed.


* Changes in Cdecl 3.1.4

** Fixed cv-qualifier in help
The <cv-qualifier> in the help text was missing '>'.


* Changes in Cdecl 3.1.3

** Fixed synonyms in explain
Explanations no longer wrongly allow English synonyms.


* Changes in Cdecl 3.1.2

** Fixed declarations with storage-class
Declarations like:
    declare x as static pointer to function returning int
    declare x as type pointer to function returning int
are fixed.


* Changes in Cdecl 3.1.1

** Parallel builds
Parallel builds are fixed.

** Manual page caveats
Added additional caveats: qualified C++ data members or member functions are
not supported.


* Changes in Cdecl 3.1

** Ref-qualifiers
Now supports C++11 function ref-qualifiers.

** Installs c++decl
A "make install" will now also create c++decl as a symbolic link to cdecl.


* Changes in Cdecl 3.0.1

** Renamed --disable-debug to --disable-cdecl-debug
Renamed this configure option to avoid clash with conventional --disable-debug
option.


* Changes in Cdecl 3.0

** GNU Autotools
The GNU Autotools suite is now used to build.

Long (GNU-style) command-line options, e.g., --language, are now accepted.

** Multi-line input
Long commands can now be given across multiple lines by escaping the newlines
with a backslash.

function trailing return-type syntax.

** Optional returning
In pseudo-English for functions, the "returning" clause is now optional and
equivalent to returning void.

** Number bases
Binary, octal, and hexadecimal numbers can now be used for array sizes.

** Better warning an error messages
Warning and error messages are now better, complete with location information
and color.

** Comments
C /*...*/ and C++ // comments are now ignored.

** No cdecl reserved words in C declarations
Reserved words that are part of cdecl's pseudo-English are no longer considered
such when explaining C or C++ declarations.
