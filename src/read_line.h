 *  + \a prompts is non-NULL; and:
 *  + GNU **readline**(3) is compiled in;
 *
 * then reads interactively by:
 *
 *  + Using GNU **readline**(3) to read a line with editing and autocompletion.
 *  + Adding non-whitespace-only lines to the history.
 *
 * Multiple lines separated by `\` are joined together and returned as a single
 * line.  Lines always end with a newline.
 * @endparblock
 *
 * @param sbuf The \ref strbuf to use.
 * @param fin The file to read from.  If \a fin is not connected to a TTY, does
 * not read interactively.
 * @param prompts A pointer to a 2-element array of prompts to use: the primary
 * prompt and the secondary prompt for continuation lines (lines after ones
 * ending with `\`).  If NULL, does not read interactively.
 * @param line_no A pointer to the current line number within a file that will
 * be incremented for every `\`-newline encountered. May be NULL.
 * @return Returns `false` only if encountered EOF.
